# lessen_email_hatred
## Pet project to address common and solvable issues with email inboxes
## Notable issues:
 - frequently forgetting recipients who should have been included in sending an email
 - frequently forgetting content which should have been included in sending an email
 - email is organized by recency, would prefer tasks without having to constantly set up rules
## Starting points for working with email data:
 - [Benjamin Dornel's write up for parsing outlook](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-an-email-parser-with-python-and-sql-c79cb8771dac)
## Ideas to address issues:
 - recommenders for sets of email recipients categorized by task
 - learning categories for tasks from the emails 
   - this probably could or should be left to user to easiy determine tasks at a high level
 - recommender for content - but I am not optimistic about this feature
   - watch this be the easier one
## Notes:
 - there are already products that can kanban your inbox, or do other things with inboxes, but i haven't seen any address all 3 of these problems
 - particularly the content recommender which is why i am not optimistic there
 - i also havent seen any attempts to learn from the inbox data to create task categories or to classify emails by task
 - If i can get any of this to work it would be really intersting to see if in a larger collaborative environment the emails and tasks can be used to create recommendations for collaborations between people working on similar tasks not already in communicaiton with each other.

 This project is intentionally left public as I have no intention of monetizing it even if I do get it to be successful, it would be like monetizing world peace. or coffee. we should all have free coffee.
