# lessen_email_hatred
## Pet project to address common and solvable issues with email inboxes
## Notable issues:
 - frequently forgetting recipients who should have been included in sending an email
 - frequently forgetting content which should have been included in sending an email
 - email is organized by recency, would prefer tasks without having to constantly set up rules
## Starting points for working with email data:
 - [Benjamin Dornel's write up for parsing outlook](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-an-email-parser-with-python-and-sql-c79cb8771dac)
## Ideas to address issues:
 - recommenders for sets of email recipients categorized by task
 - learning categories for tasks from the emails 
 - - this probably could or should be left to user to easiy determine tasks at a high level
 - recommender for content - but I am not optimistic about this feature
 - - watch this be the easier one

 This project is intentionally left public as I have no intention of monetizing it even if I do get it to be successful, it would be like monetizing world peace. or coffee. we should all have free coffee.
